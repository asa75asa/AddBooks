This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your batch_rename application.


batch_rename.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

batch_rename.cpp
    This is the main application source file.
